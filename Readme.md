# 📚 **Book Club Tracker**

A decentralized application (dApp) built with Solidity, Web3.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to allow users to **log books, share reviews, and update their thoughts** on a blockchain network.

---

## 🚀 **Overview**

The **Book Club Tracker** is a smart contract-based platform that allows users to:
1. **Add books** with details like title, author, and review.
2. **Update reviews** for existing books.
3. **Fetch book details** (title, author, review, and owner).
4. **Track the total number of books** added to the club.

This dApp leverages **Ethereum blockchain** for secure and immutable data storage.

## ⚙️ **Setup Instructions**

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

### **1. Prerequisites**
- **Node.js** (Optional for serving the frontend)
- **MetaMask Extension** installed in your browser
- Ethereum Test Network (e.g., Sepolia, Goerli)

### **2. Smart Contract Deployment**
1. Install the Truffle framework or Hardhat.
2. Compile the contract:
   ```bash
   truffle compile
   ```
3. Deploy the contract to a test network:
   ```bash
   truffle migrate --network <network-name>
   ```
4. Copy the **contract address** and **ABI**.

### **3. Run Frontend**
1. Replace the **contract ABI** and **address** in `index.html`:
   ```js
   const CONTRACT_ABI = [ /* Paste your ABI here */ ];
   const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "0xYourContractAddressHere";
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in a browser.
3. Connect your MetaMask wallet and interact with the dApp.
